## Description

Wine cellar is an application that allows users to build their own wine inventory. Users need to log in to manage the wine inventory by adding, updating and deleting items. In addition, it allows users to customize their collection by uploading a new wine, including bottle name, wine type, price and other detailed information. At last but not the least, users can view others' wines.
